# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To further improve the PlanMyTrip app, upper management has asked to increase the capabilities of the app to take user inputs so the background weather data can be further narrowed down by the user parameters. From the cities that fell between the userâ€™s weather preferences, the app would then identify any potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From this selection, the user would then choose four closely located cities for the app to create  both a travel itinerary and travel route utilizing the Google Maps Directions API.

With the improved app, end users can now obtain all of the aforementioned pieces of travel information.

All cities within the weather parameters and the nearest hotel:
